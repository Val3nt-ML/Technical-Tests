# Technical-Tests

Here you will find a technical test I made for Airbus in 2019.
The goal was to predict the accuracy of an intern model which estimates a certain cost.

To some extent, you will find in the first part of the code, all the data preparation steps 
and then the modelisation of classical machine learning algorithms :
- Linear Regression
- SVM
- Multi-Layers Perceptron
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- XG Boost
- Ensemble models
